      It is not made of brass or wood.
      It does not have history dated centuries ago.
      Rather my instrument does have keys like a piano.
</p>
<p className="story">
      It makes sounds when keys are press, “clickety clack”
      Maybe it is not music to your ears.
      But to me:
      .this is my instrument and let me make coding music
      so your eyes can see;
      delight your senses
      </span>my horizon
</p>
      <p className="lastVerse">
      Right now, I spend my life tuning my instrument

      So let me get back to work.
